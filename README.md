# Project Overview
This project explores how the sensory attributes of coffee (like aroma, acidity, body, or flavor) influence its quality score.

By using data from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), we can see if certain characteristics (such as acidity or sweetness) are better indicators of a high-quality coffee. This project will allow comparision between two types of coffee: Arabica and Robusta, to check if they share similar quality patterns.

The final goal is to understand what makes a coffee “good” and see whether different species are valued differently based on their sensory profile.
